I can't believe that after **so much** study, i'm finally taking the first step.

## First App

This is just a sample landing page working as a single page application.

The purpose of this project is only to be used as a sample for customers to review or storefront.

## Next.js

The purpose of using next.js is in order to improve SEO and making use of static and hybrid rendering to also improve performance.

## What's coming next

After finishing the front end part, i'm thinking in refactoring the project using typescript and also create sor of a backend functionality that allows Clients to update content from a headless CMS.
